السلام عليكم

This is a crawler and indexer GUI, it provides:

- Inverted Index for any documents 
- Biword Index for any documents 
- Positional Index for any documents 
- Crawler to crawl starting from a seed link.
- Query Search page that searches for a query in a set of docs or calc the cosine similarity between the docs and the query and ranks the results.

- To Run the GUI Application follow the path:
GUI.src.main.java.org.example.gui.HelloApplication

- To Run the code in the terminal follow the path:
GUI.src.main.java.invertedIndex.Main

- The Folder from which I read the data:
ALL_Indexing_methods\tmp11\rl\

- The Folders where I store the indexing:  
ALL_Indexing_methods\tmp11\             ==> for inverted index
ALL_Indexing_methods\tmp11_biword\      ==> for Bi-word
ALL_Indexing_methods\tmp11_positional\  ==> for Positional
